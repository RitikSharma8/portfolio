My personal online portfolio, meticulously crafted to showcase my expertise in both Web Development and Graphic Design. This site is a dynamic and responsive platform designed to present my projects and skills with a modern, intentional aesthetic.

What You'll Find Inside:

*   Responsive Experience: Fully adaptive layout ensuring an optimal viewing experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, complete with a smooth, JavaScript-driven mobile navigation.
*   Highlighting My Work: Dedicated sections to dive into my Web Development projects (interactive, responsive experiences) and Graphic Design creations (visual identity, branding).
*   A Glimpse Into My World: A dynamic "About Me" section featuring a personal video loop and a detailed overview of my skills and background.
*   Connect With Me: A sleek and functional contact form, integrated with Formspree, making it easy for visitors to reach out directly.

This portfolio is a living testament to my passion for crafting bold, clean, and impossible-to-ignore visuals and user experiences.
